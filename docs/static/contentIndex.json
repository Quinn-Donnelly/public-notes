Then I would break those down to quarters then weeks then days. The issue with this was that it encouraged me to take a year to make meaningful change.\nThis also meant that if I slipped up one quarter it was fine because the “deliverable” wasn’t due till year end and I could make up for it in the next quarter. This led to some very busy Q4s and less meaningful change standing the test of time.\nIn school it was much the same just swap in semesters for quarters.\nWhat\nThe idea of this was from The 12 week year book. Basically the idea is that I needed to have a “right sized” cadence of delivery. Something large enough to make meaningful change but not too large as to encourage procrastination.\nI am not married to it being 12 weeks but something in that general area seems about right. They do loosely sync up with quarters.\n52 weeks a year\n48 weeks a year for execution\n4 weeks for planning / downtime\nThe order goes something like\n\nWeek of planning the next 12 week\n12 weeks of execution\nWeek of review / planning / taking a breather\n12 weeks of execution\nWeek of review / planning / taking a breather\n12 weeks of execution\nWeek of review / planning / taking a breather\n12 weeks of execution\n\nToward end of year / beginning of next year the holiday season will end up breaking it up a bit shortening a 12 week here or there but same general plan.\nOnce again nothing magic about the number 12. Unless of course we consider the sum of its divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) equals 16, which is greater than 12 making 12 the smallest of the abundant numbers\nOutcome\nNow I aim to build 12 week plans with the following characteristics.\n\nThey need to move me meaningfully and sustainably toward the Future\n\nNew habit, lifestyle change, big life moves, new skill acquisition, etc.\n\n\nThey must be tangible, measurable in some way.\n\nI usually prefer to have a leading metric be my guide during the 12 week, and a trailing metric inform me if that change is having the effect I was hoping for during planning. I don’t concern myself with the trailing metric when I’m executing the 12 week.\n\n\nI limit myself to 2 at a time\n\npart of me wishes I could make this one at a time\nMy 2 are 1 for professional life and 1 for personal\n\nSimplified example from a few years ago\n\nProfessional: Move to a large enterprise company\nPersonal: Move into the city proper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"Knowledge/Capture":{"title":"Capture","links":["Notion","Processing"],"tags":[],"content":"What?\nCapture for me is making sure that all ideas and requests go to one place so that I can process them at one time. From there they go to die. Few will survive and live on to the done column.\nIn Practice\nCurrently I use Notion as my primary capture tool. I have a button on all screens of my phone and a hotkey on my computer that once hit allows me to write down the thought.\nThese get processed later in Processing for now they sit in an intake list.\nWhy?\nMy brain loves to have ideas and generally loves to over value ideas. There are two primary issues that caused me to adopt this Capture system.\n\nI can tell my brain to let it go\n\nI will stay stuck on an idea loving the idea and playing with it in my head like a distracting toy. This takes me off task and away from what I was intending to remain focused on.\nThis practice allows me to tell my brain: “It’s there we will think about it later now back to task”. If I don’t do this my brain likes to constantly remind me of the idea while working as to now forget it.\n\n\nI don’t make good investment decisions in the moment\n\n\nIf I allow my mind to make a call right then and there about whether or not I will or will not proceed with some idea or solving some problem I am more likely to spend my time in wasteful a manner.\nI generally over value new ideas and find additional time between idea inception and decision making allows me to increase the rationality of my decisions. Especially around how I spend my time.\n\n\n\n\nI’m sure having capture systems has given me more positive benefits than what is listed above. In my professional life where I need to juggle multiple priorities being organized helps. But the above 2 are my primary reasons why I put up with the toil."},"Knowledge/Future":{"title":"Future","links":["Knowledge/make-an-picture-album-of-things-that-resonate-to-future-vision","Knowledge/The-practice-of-recording-things-that-resonate-with-you"],"tags":[],"content":"I like to map out my view of the future.

My workflow goes through expansions and contractions naturally. “The way I work” is a practice I do to help with contracting my workflow and distilling it down to the essential parts.\n\n\n                  \n                  Simplification \n                  \n                \n\nIf you force me to write down my process it will become much more simple… Because I’m lazy, and I use that to my advantage\n\n\nSo I write this for me with the goal of simplification.

Two recommendations:\n\nDon’t adopt multiple things at once, resist that urge. Add most valuable thing first, evaluate it’s effect, keep or discard, and then repeat.\nTake the WHY of my process and ask yourself it applies to you. The specifics of how I do it are irrelevant, the notes I take, capture systems imployed, etc. don’t matter as much as the thing I’m trying to do and how my systems help me do it.\n\n\n\nThe Core\nThe way I view my system today is through the lens of two buckets.\nCadence\nThe goal is to make sure that I balance short term and long term thinking. While also ensuring I don’t spend too much time on “meta” work. I want the vast majority of my time going towards actually doing.\nPractices\nThings that help me DO.
