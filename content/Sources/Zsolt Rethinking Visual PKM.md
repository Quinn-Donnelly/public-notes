Thought through his knowledge management system 
- files
- folders
- links
- tags
- dataview

are the core of his system. 

Manages his tags with [[Tag Wragler]] uses [[Inline Dataview Fields]] and [[Frontmater Fields]] 

The formating for his visual notes is nice as he uses the preset sizes in [[Excalidraw]] with largest preset only used in the center and a decrement in sizes as he goes out layers. 

He has a heavy use of [[icons]] to create a visual language to himself

Mentions the [[ACCESS]] pattern which is another peice of content from [[Nick Milo]]
