Actual start of the introduction of what will be covered. Seems to be [[motivation]]. [[purpose]] [[Spirituality]]

Dharma/[[Ikigai]]/jihad
Seems to be loosely translated to your purpose in life. 

> [!NOTE] Extract
> likely need to extract the above 3

[32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1966&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
He makes the claim that the issue with the above (Dharma / ikigai) etc. more generally the issue with [[Spirituality]] is that experience is key to learning and in the modern age we have separated the two. We only value the intellectual understanding and have devalued the experience based knowledge that can't be articulated. 

## [[Dukkha]]
[35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2116&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
[[Dukkha]]
Du - bad
Kha - space

Space where space doesn't belong.

[38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2292&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
Get rid of the void within us. 

Comes up again at [42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2556&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
it has 4 parts or things that will get you out of [[Dukkha]] you need all 4 not just 1. 
1. [[Dharma]] - Duty
2. [[Artha]] - wealth
3. [[Kama]] - pleasure
4. [[Moksha]] - liberation 

## [[Dhri]]
- support (constant)
It's about harmony - silimar to [[Telos]] from the greek philosophers

## [[Dharma]]
Duty

[49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2955&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
This makes suffering tolerable / or a decision
For instance a doctor who feels a duty to help their patients they will work late hours even though that's the painful option they do it due to their duty to their patients. 

[53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3239&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
Being driven by pleasure only will build your tolerance to pleasure which now means your stuck as pleasure is what makes you take action. But overtime that pleasure falls off as your tolerance goes up. 

Due to the above you need to move away from pleasure. You need a competing interest to move away and break this addiction.

[1:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3601&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
story about getting a guy to stop smoking because he felt duty to his daughter he wanted to walk her down the isle. He asked the smoker whether he wanted to be wheeling an oxygen tank behind him when doing that. That gave him his reason to stop. 

### How to find your [[Dharma]]
[1:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3923&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
it's about increasing the [[harmony]] in your life. Does everything in life feel frictional or fluid. 

[1:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=4066&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
Big dream sabotage our ability to work

It will make daily actions very low significance toward the outcome of your purpose so you will not get driven to action. The larger the dream the less the significance of any action. 

1. Take care of yourself

This is the first [[Dharma]]

2. Seemed to be a bit of a tangent here with inside vs outside motivation and you should gain inside motivation through set of steps below

Your attention is externalized? 

How to find your [[Dharma]]
1. Introspect spend more time with yourself
2. ------------
3. There weren't any bullets after that

[1:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=5263&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
his opinion is that your [[Dharma]] is waiting for you. He is confident that it is out there but you are not ready for it. Thus you need to make yourself ready then you can find it. 

[1:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=5587&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
If you won't do it who would if no one well then that's your [[Dharma]]. As you continue to grow your [[Dharma]] will get more and more difficult you'll get larger more difficult ones that will demand more of you. 

If it increases the [[harmony]] of your life it is [[Dharma]]. If it doesn't then it's not. 

[1:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=6090&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
You should introspect and take care of yourself. First start with that then listen and you will take small steps to work your way up. 

[1:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=6523&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
Do you want to live a life that is controlled by what you want which is left to the whims of your mind which is conditioned to what you are exposed to. 

[1:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=6624&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
Control your Mind
Your mind wants to think about X and you stop it and tell it to thing about Y (nothing). 

Let yourself be bored. Learn to be bored. Go to the bathroom without your phone go on a flight without any entertainment. etc. 

Once you are bored then you can direct it to do what you've decided to do. 

## [[Moksha]]
[1:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=7012&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)

[1:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=7162&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
Wants are temporary. Once you get it the pleasure of it will not last. 

[2:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=7320&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
Layers of self
Physical realm 
which is subject to evolution. 

Mind
Things the mind wants - social needs etc. Love respect etc. 

But yet you can satisfy these two and still not be satisfied. 

[2:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=7703&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
talking about attention again and transcendental spaces.
attention without any object of focus. Do this by focusing on one thing. Then your body / mind will acclimatize to that thing and it will disappear thus there will be nothing. 

20 mins twice a day meditate. He did the om chanting practice. You can mix in yoga. He had fancy words for it that I can't type right now [2:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=8347&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)

1. Do it
2. Pay attention to vibration
3. focus on the localization of the vibration
4. perfect the vibration - no jumps in the sound a smooth movement of the vibration from stomach to head
	1. The om makes vibration in stomach and moves up to the head. 
5. Vibration starts at the front of the body but then moves toward the back [2:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=8815&v=AiXiyLJz8-U) he describes this as a non physical column you will feel. 

[2:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=8935&v=AiXiyLJz8-U)
Do we have proof of the existence of thought. We can correlate with scans but no hard proof of thought. 

it all is as it is meaning is attached to it only in the physical realm. 

## [[Artha]]
Protects you against the world. Gives you a resource to protect you.
