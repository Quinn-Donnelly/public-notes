# Backend Engineering Interview Loop

When you apply for a backend engineering role at Netflix, or if one of our recruiters or hiring managers find your LinkedIn profile interesting, a recruiter or hiring manager reviews your technical background and experience to see if your experience is aligned with our requirements. If so, we invite you to begin the interview process.

Most backend engineering teams follow a process very similar to what is shown below. While this is a relatively stream-lined process, it is not as efficient if a candidate is interested in or qualified for multiple roles within the organization.

Following is a brief description of each of these stages.

**Recruiter Phone Screen:** A member of our talent team contacts you to explain the process and to assess high-level qualifications . The recruiter also reviews the relevant open roles to see if you have a strong affinity for one or another. If your interests and experience align well with one or more of the roles, they schedule a phone screen with one of the hiring managers.

**Manager Phone Screen:** The purpose of this discussion is to get a sense for your technical background, your approach to problem solving, and how you work. It’s also a great opportunity for you to learn more about the available roles, the technical challenges the teams are facing and what it’s like to work on a backend engineering team at Netflix.

**Technical Screen:** The final screen before on-site interviews is used to assess your technical skills and match for the team. For many roles, you will be given a choice between a take-home coding exercise or a one-hour discussion with one of the engineers from the team. The problems you are asked to solve are related to the work of the team.

**Round 1 Interviews:** If you are invited on-site, the first round interview is with four or five people for 45 minutes each. The interview panel consists of two or three engineers, a hiring manager and a recruiter. The engineers assess your technical skills by asking you to solve various design and coding problems. These questions reflect actual challenges that our teams face.

**Round 2 Interviews:** You meet with two or three additional people, for 45 minutes each. The interview panel comprises an engineering director, a partner engineer or manager, and another engineering leader. The focus of this round is to assess how well you partner with other teams and your non-technical skills.

**Decision & Offer:** After round 2, we review the feedback and decide whether or not we will be offering you a role. If so, you will work with the recruiter to discuss compensation expectations, answer any questions that remain for you, and discuss a start date with your new team.
