- Folders
	- Top down way of thinking
- Atomic notes
	- Will become bottom up thinking
- Maps of Content
	- Middle out thinking

There are a few ways of approaching problems
- Top down
- bottom up
- Middle out

If you already know what you want to talk about then you can create a [[Maps of Content]] and work from there. Good for things that have structure where in you already know the high level points or sections to explore.

The other approach is exploratory gathering all the atomic notes you can then allowing them to push you to [[Mental Squeeze Point]] where in you can then use the relationships formed to build a [[Maps of Content]] from the data.

Emergence Levels
- Level 1 - Making atomic notes
	- Collecting from the primordial idea soup (sources, ideas, interactions, insights)
	- New ideas solidify in to unique notes
	- Divergence
		- From the Collection and extraction phase, new ideas solidify into unique shapes.
	- [[Zettelkasten]] - without links
	- Some place holders some half-formed
	- These are ideas without structure
- Level 2 - Growing and connecting your ideas 
	- Now as notes have grown relationships will start to form and emerge
- Level 3 - Creating the [[Maps of Content]]
	- The [[Mental Squeeze Point]] will cause you to want to make a map of content so that you can offload the mental burden
	- There are three phases here
			- Found another reference to three different names
				- Dump
					- Dumping all relevant notes into one MOC
					- Get crystal clear on the scope
				- Lump
					- You start to ask questions about your map at this phase
						- How best to structure the notes that were dumped here?
				- Jump
					- Let it cook, walk away move on come back and you will have a new perspective on it.
					- This period lasts an infinite amount of time because you will never truly "finish" you will continue to reflect on it and grow your understanding and thoughts over time.
		- Assemble
		- Colliding
			- Let the ideas fight each other and collide. Colliding ideas are the key to next level thinking.
		- Unifying
- Level 4 - MOCs of MOCs
	- Higher order notes which will become an ecosystem
- Level 5 - Emergence 
	- Highest order of MOCs
	- Main areas of focus a distillation of the current knowledge and areas of involvement
