## Go into Newspaper Mode
Back in Benjamin franklin times, you could read local newspaper there was no new info till next paper time. That's the mode you should go into during our distraction times. Daily distilled newspaper was good enough for all the big historical figures it's good enough for us. The rest of news we can wait till it's distilled for us 

you don't need up to the min updates.

## Move up the information food chain
Major newspapers, independent reporters. Newsletters. Let someone else eat the alge of information you read their distillations

## Seek flow states
Get lost in an unrelated activity it will help you get out of cognitive shock of news

## Hard Day Protocol
Two checkins a day. you think it through then you will evaluate the thoughts. then you end the though later if you start thinking on it you remind yourself you already throught through it all. 

## Take Breaks from your phone
temporarily separate yourself from your phone. Put friction in the way of using your phone

## Work on something delightful
Something satisfying that is completely unrelated to stress that is bugging you. Something that will let you run down a rabbit hole.
