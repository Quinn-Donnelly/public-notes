# Summary 
Phenomenal article on the use of personal memory systems and some learning about using [[Anki]] as that system.
# Body
There are many references on the history of computer aided memory enhancement.

In his proposal for the web, Berners-Lee describes the need for his employer (the particle physics organization CERN) to develop a collective institutional memory, 

- This essay will focus on personal memory system
- [[Anki]] is the tool [[Micheal Neilson]] uses
- He defends [[rote memory]] saying that it is central to problem solving and creativity
	- [[rote memory]] is often attacked as being inferior to other types of understanding 


> [!TIP] Future work to read later
> [Toward a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer](http://augmentingcognition.com/taylip.html), I will describe more ideas for personal memory systems. 


## The Anki system
- Brief description of how anki works.


> [!QUOTE] The exponential effect of Anki
> By contrast, Anki's ever-expanding review intervals quickly rise past a month and then out past a year. Indeed, for my personal set of Anki cards the average interval between reviews is currently 1.2 years, and rising. In an [appendix](about:reader?url=http%3A%2F%2Faugmentingcognition.com%2Fltm.html#Anki_analysis) below I estimate that for an average card, I'll only need 4 to 7 minutes of total review time over the entire 20 years. Those estimates allow for occasional failed reviews, resetting the time interval. That's a factor of more than 20 in savings over the more than 2 hours required with conventional flashcards.

- If memorizing a facts seems worth 10 mins of my time then do it. (use anki)
- If a fact seems striking then into Anki it goes regardless of the first rule


> [!QUOTE] Example outcome of use
> I've used Anki to create a little over 10,000 cards over about 2 and a half years of regular use. That includes a 7-month break when I made very few new cards. When I'm keeping up with my card review, it takes about 15 to 20 minutes per day. If it routinely rises to much more than 20 minutes it usually means I'm adding cards too rapidly, and need to slow down. Alternately, it sometimes means I'm behind on my card review (which I'll discuss later).

- he first uses anki successfully when he has a target he is after - learning [[UNIX]] command line
- His next use came from trying to write a topic on reinforcement learning done in Alpha go (focuses more on the importance of alpha go) but the new feild being important to the angle I am reading from
	- He skimmed the paper for 2 outcomes
		- Identify the important ideas in the paper
		- "hoovering process" looking for basic facts that he could understand easily that would obviously benefit him.
			- Examples of things entered into Anki for this
	- He skimmed the paper multiple times
		- didn't worry about parts that he didn't understand he just moved on
		- 5 to 6 repetitions before he did a close read
	- Later year or so when Alpha Zero papers came out he still remembered enough to read those papers easily even having not thought about the topic since
	- Seems to indicate while you may move quicker for the first paper with traditional notes you would not have retained the knowledge and sped through the later papers without the Anki Method
				
> [!QUOTE] Anki prompt examples for hoovering process 
> Here's a few examples of the kind of question I entered into Anki at this stage: “What's the size of a Go board?”; “Who plays first in Go?”; “How many human game positions did AlphaGo learn from?”; “Where did AlphaGo get its training data?”; “What were the names of the two main types of neural network AlphaGo used?”

- The above seemed to work so well due to the emotional connection with the outcome

### Notes on shallow read usecases
- For shallow reads he will extract 5 to 20 questions from the paper
- Usually questions come from figures, abstract, or conclusion, focuses on core ideas of the paper
- Low connections to other things indicates poor paper, If it generates less that 5 questions in anki he doesn't add any of the questions.
- Don't Ankify incorrect information you will actively make yourself stupider
	- Remember things as a claim from a source not as a point of fact. That helpful encoding will avoid the above failure case
	- You can add questions specifically about the quality struggles of claims. What's one challenge in determining X that is discus in the paper. etc. 
- You can make graphs or figures the answer, visualize the graph from X about topic Y
	- Graph is on the back of the card
	- Ask specific questions about the graph to increase understanding 
		- What is the peak of the figure
- completion ism is unproductive reading habit
	- If you feel your can easily find something more rewarding to read then switch over. 10-60 mins is max for his paper reading unless something is truly striking

### Notes on syntopic reading using Anki
- Engage with key papers of the field deeply

> [!QUOTE] Reasons for reading key papers
> You might suppose the foundation would be a shallow read of a large number of papers. In fact, to really grok an unfamiliar field, you need to engage deeply with key papers – papers like the AlphaGo paper. What you get from deep engagement with important papers is more significant than any single fact or technique: you get a sense for what a powerful result in the field looks like. It helps you imbibe the healthiest norms and standards of the field. It helps you internalize how to ask good questions in the field, and how to put techniques together. You begin to understand what made something like AlphaGo a breakthrough – and also its limitations, and the sense in which it was really a natural evolution of the field. Such things aren't captured individually by any single Anki question. But they begin to be captured collectively by the questions one asks when engaged deeply enough with key papers. 

- awknologies that finding the most important papers is hard which is why he ends up reading 100s but keeping those shallow until he determines which are key


> [!QUOTE] [[How to Read a Book]]
> Over time, this is a form of what Mortimer Adler and Charles van Doren dubbed _syntopic reading_** In their marvelous “How to Read a Book”: Mortimer J. Adler and Charles van Doren, “How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading” (1972).

- [[Micheal Neilson]]'s thinking on personal memory systems was heavily influenced by Piotr Wozniak, [Incremental Reading](https://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm)
### More patterns of Anki use

> [!TIP] Read this for Anki use ideas
> Piotr Wozniak, [Effective learning: Twenty rules of formulating knowledge](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules).

- Make anki questions atomic - 1 idea as self contained as can be

> [!QUOTE] Example of making question atomic
> The solution was to refactor the question by breaking it into two pieces. One piece was: “What's the basic command and option to create a Unix soft link?” Answer: “`ln -s …`”. And the second piece was: “When creating a Unix soft link, in what order do `linkname` and `filename` go?” Answer: “`filename linkname`”.


- Use one big deck


> [!QUOTE] This is just funny enjoy
> One moment Anki is asking me a question about the temperature chicken should be cooked to. The next: a question about the JavaScript API. Is this mixing doing me any real good? I'm not sure. I have not, as yet, found any reason to use JavaScript to control the cooking of a chicken. But I don't think this mixing does any harm, and hope it is creatively stimulating, and helps me apply my knowledge in unusual contexts.

- Don't add orphan questions make sure they closely relate to something else in your memory
- Don't share decks it is useful to put personal knowledge like reasons you wouldn't work with someone at work even if talented you put into the deck the situations which make you think that
- Constructing your own decks is part of the learning
- Cultivate strategies for elaboration encoding / forming rich associations. 
	- use multiple variations of the "same" question
- He covers memory palaces here - references another author for more information
	- Joshua Foer, “Moonwalking with Einstein” (2011).
	- He seems to be of my mind of thinking that they do work but are mostly useful for trivia information not deep concept.
- 95% of anki's value comes from 5% of it's features
	- Don't worry about optimally using all it's features use the core ones well and focus on what you are actually trying to learn

### Challenges with Anki
- Procedural
	- You may remember a command in unix but not when or how to spot a candidate for it's use

Getting past "names don't matter" 
- He's a theoretical physist by training. 
- He puts prompts to picture what Emily Hare's painting looks like and answer is the picture of painting
	- He gets to put a name to the painting instead of just familiar feeling to it

- Missing a day
	- Set yourself a daily quota and you'll catch up soon enough
	- Wishes for a catch up feature


> [!QUOTE] Good reference number of questions from a medium
> For seminars and conversations with colleagues I find it surprisingly helpful to set Anki quotas. For instance, for seminars I try to find at least three high-quality questions to Ankify. For extended conversations, at least one high-quality question to Ankify. I've found that setting quotas helps me pay more attention, especially during seminars. (I find it much easier _a priori_ to pay attention in one-on-one conversation.)

- be careful with books, large time commitment make sure you want to ankify it. Will it serve long term goals is it worth taking the time now to ankify or should you wait till you distill some key points.

- Avoid too many yes/no answers

Reasons for Anki not being widely adopted
- People underestimate the gains that come from distributing their study. They prefer cramming
- The psychologist Robert Bjork has suggested**Robert A. Bjork**, [Memory and Metamemory Considerations in the Training of Human Beings](http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Bjork1994.pdf) (1994). the “principle of desirable difficulty” people don't like difficult things good memory systems are systematically difficult
- Challenging to use and easy to use poorly

## Part 2: Personal memory systems Broadly
Chunking the ability to have higher levels of structure like chess masters is useful when working with ideas. Increasing ability for working memory. 

Roughly 7 chuncks of working memory. The number varies similarly in line with IQ. But you can work how much a chunk can hold see chess masters.

### Role of cognitive science in the design of systems to augment cognition
- We don't understand .well the exponential decay of memory


> [!QUOTE] Clarity on stance of the model
> I don't mention this to undermine your belief in the Ebbinghaus model. But rather as a caution: memory is complicated, we don't understand many of the big picture questions well, and we should be careful before we put too much faith in any given model.
> 
> With all that said: the basic effects underlying distributed practice and the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve are real, large, and have been confirmed by many experiments. Effects like that discovered by Oehrn are less important by comparison.
