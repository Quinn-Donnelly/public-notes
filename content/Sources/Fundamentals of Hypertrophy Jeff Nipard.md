I will need to determine which split to do for workouts.
- From what I am reading the body part split - 5 day is the best for me. Due to the fact that I don't want to be in the gym for 4 hrs getting a bunch of workouts across my full body done.

I have added the week 1 of the [[5 day body part split]] to [[Strong App]]
