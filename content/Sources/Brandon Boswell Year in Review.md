[His 2022 Year in review](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/2022-In-Review)

Something about this spoke to me when I saw it. As time goes on you'll forget much of a year. I like the idea of aggregating at multiple levels. Things that really stick with you in a day go in a day note, things that stuck in a week go in week note, stuck in "chunk" be that quarter, semester, or 12 week go in that note, and then a year note.

I can imagine myself looking back at this when I'm 125 and being thankful I have these. *P.S. future Quinn if you're reading this at 125, confirmed beer is a preservative*
