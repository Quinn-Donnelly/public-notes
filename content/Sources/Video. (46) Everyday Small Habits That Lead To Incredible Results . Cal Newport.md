Watched through this at night the main take aways I had are 
- Go on thinking walks
	- I do this naturally these days but have been falling off of it recently. 
- Set themes of days. 
	- Monday planning 
		- Have a big block of time that people can grab from or stop by during
	- Friday early shutdown etc.
- Set task quotas 
	- Helps with the deprioritization of asks based on hitting a reasonable quota.
- Do something hard
	- Drives up [[Fuffilment]] gives you sense of purpose.
- Daily working memory note
	- My obsidian use likely covers this for majority of things
