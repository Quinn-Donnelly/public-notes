[[Personal Knowledge Management]]

Looking at [Zsolt's rethinking video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtdAAD47aQY&ab_channel=Zsolt%27sVisualPersonalKnowledgeManagement)

1. Method and process of taking notes are personal and will grow over time

# [[Content First Approach]]
You create a new page for every time you work on something
- you are in a meeting
- you work on your hobby
- etc

Could still use a daily notes practice as a guide through the system

# [[Topic First Approach]]
You have separate index page or MOC (map of content) for key topics such as [[Zettelkasten]]

# [[Action First]]
[[PARA]] would fall into this category

# Zsolt's Current Setup
![[zsolts-knowledge-management-visual|100%]]

## Folders
Folders as namespaces is and interesting concept. The issue i have is that this creates a one relationship. Thus this must be an immutable truth that is self evident and first thing that comes to mind. 

Naming with a date seems odd to me, this can just be meta data and with the use of [[Git|git]] I truly don't feel like i need it

For default location for files sue to my workflow of checking things into git i don't need to have settings like this as my point to put things in their place. 

## Tags
Only gives a single tag to a page. The think here is likely using tags for one thing and links for others. For tags he uses them as meta data to define what a note is, for instance calling out [[Maps of Content|maps of content]] 

The above works well with [[excalibrain]] which is a [[Visual Knowledge Management]] system. 

## Links
Uses ontology this creates a type of relationship between the notes. 

# Take Away
There are parts of this system that i link and should take away but there are others in which he is working around tools that I will not need to (obsidian sync vs git)

## Todos From This
- [ ] Setup Maps of Content
	- [ ] Make sure this can work with ontology
		- [ ] Need the autocomplete for ontology
		- [ ] Make sure excaidraw allows link creates relationships
	- [ ] Look into creating standard headings for notes - this will make transclusions easier
		- [ ] use templr to setup up / automate the headers
- [ ] Do we need daily notes to aid with temporal data? Meta data usually handles this for me but need to make a decision
	- [ ] Maps and Time and used with daily notes
		- [ ] Using time links on notes to do things like - [timestamp](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=2078)
- [ ] Filename conventions
	- [ ] there are some automation oppurtunites at the [end of the video](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1687) that make use of prefix on file name
- [ ] Templates
	- [ ] To create notes, files, multiple files, lines in a note etc. - [Timestamp](https://youtu.be/nJ660t5ku9A?t=1796)
- [ ] Check out It's About time in [[zsolts-knowledge-management-visual]]
	- This is his way of getting todos integrated into his knowledge system
