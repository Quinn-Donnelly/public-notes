# Summary
**Overall do High -> moderate-low will be the most effective while fasted**
Once that is under control make sure the following are also in order. 
- Sleep
- EPA
- Glutamine
- Fermented foods
- Iodine
- Selenium

# Introduction
Caloric intake vs expenditure is still the golden rule of losing fat. But calorie burned portion is influenced by a number of factors that you can control, [see timestamp](https://youtu.be/GqPGXG5TlZw?t=619), ex. how warm/cold you make it, level of mentalism, thyroid. 

There are several types of body fat controlled by [[Types of body fat]] which has to do with how the neurons are bound to each other. 

Supplements thorn is [[Andrew Huberman]]'s recommendation - see [link](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbjJPQ2tpOW1kNlMtanBwdzJaV01MdFY1SF85QXxBQ3Jtc0trRDhTMjhOZkNiQ1FxQXo0dkJhdUdQNzRUX1M3SS13VENvMmVpZEgwclJmT0hRNFZ6MnI1R2picWdEODZ6aHE3djl5RWdiaVZoM1FCQXU2NEdmS1JYRkgxb2t3SkExZFN1djQyVzJTbGVVcmtlYzFOYw&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thorne.com%2Fu%2Fhuberman&v=GqPGXG5TlZw)

[[Sleep]] is important for regulating, as well as [[fatty acids]] essential fatty acid. People that have [[cravings]] due to shortages in amino acids and essential fatty acids. Iodine levels and selenium levels need to be right for thyroid system - [[Brazil Nuts]] (don't overdue it).

The core things to get right which influence the calories burned
- Sleep
- EPA
- Glutamine
- Fermented foods
- Iodine
- Selenium

Thinking can influence the effects of burning fat. - [[Alia Crum]] at Stanford - [see research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17425538/) on [[Mind-set Matters Exercise and the placebo effect]]. It is true that they may have had different behavior because of the knowledge but that in and of itself is an effect of the mind set.

[[adipose tissue]]?

[[Thermogenesis]]? 

# How it works
It is a two step process 
1. Fat mobilization - [[lipolysis]]
2. Fat oxidation (utilization)

Mobilization 
[[Fatty acid]] is attached to glycerol attached by a backbone. To mobilize the fat you need to break the backbone via the enzyme lipase. This will get the fatty acids in the blood stream. 

Oxidize it will convert it into energy by the fat moving into the mitochondria to be burned.

### Mobilization
Epinephrine which is adrenaline sympathetic nervous system and a gland above the kidneys. The adrenaline that causes the mobilization is a local process which the neurons connected to the fat inject the adrenaline not the adrenaline in your bloodstream. 

Shivering or small forms of movement is a good way to increase energy burn. Good way to increase calories burned without needing large increase in time investment. These movements trigger the epinephrine in the fat to mobilize it. The practice of using this is a movement called [[NEAT]]. 

## [[Types of body fat]]

1. White Fat
	1. This is what you typically think of stores energy
2. Brown 
	1. Rich with mitochondria, take food and convert to energy it is thermogenic
3. Beige
	1. White fat that could be brown fat but doesn't have enough mitochondria

# Cold Exposure
Cold exposure, by shivering, will increase the amount of brown fat it will also activate your brown fat, happens through succinate. 

Get into cold, get out of cold, get back in, repeat. Just cold enough to feel cold 1 to 3 times a week get in start shivering stay for 1 min then get out for 1 to 3 mins then get back in repeat 3 times. Try not to create cold tolerance too much.

# Exercise 
- HIIT
	- [[High Intensity Interval Training]]
- SIT
	- Sprint interval training
		- All out 8-30 seconds 30 min rest
- MICT
	- [[Moderate Intensity Continuous Training]]

**Should you fast**
3 to 24 hours of not eating. Insulin will prevent fat oxidation. However for short periods of training it doesn't show effect* (note around that). 

1. At a period of 90 min of moderate exercise there is a switch over where past 90 min point you would burn more if you hadn't eaten before hand
2. High intensity training - can't be maintained for more than 60 seconds. Switch over point is earlier. If you are fasted then your insulin is lower thus the fat burn effect will happen more quickly.
3. Because of the above you can use high intensity to trigger the fat burning effects then move to a medium intensity exercise. 

How much does an exercise effect metabolism.
High intensity burns more glycogen during the activity then more body fat after the workout
Moderate to low intensity burns more (percentage wise) body fat than glycogen during the workout then more glycogen after the exercise. 

**Overall do High -> moderate-low will be the most effective while fasted**

High intensity generates more epinephrine which is why the rates are higher.
