[[How to Read a Book]] I'm not making much progress on due to it not really being something that I can fit it at night if I'm trying to engage deeply with it. Need to somehow find another time in the day. Perhaps no everything has to be daily? Maybe [[Set play day]] idea can be used with frequent collection of day plans?
