# fugitive workflow testing
	
Currently have `<leader>gs` bound to [[fugitive]] that will open the status pane. 

The most helpful binds that I use are as follows
- cc: this will commit opening the commit screen for authoring
- =: this will toggle an inline diff
- ig?: opens the help pane
- s: stages the file
- u: unstages the file
- X: under the hood it's using checkout to revert the file
