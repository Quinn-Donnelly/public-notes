Daily notes have 2 pain points 
1. I don't need all notes back in the daily I can just create them and use meta data
2. I find the main value is making my 3 items of importance today but it ends up being more of a [[Todo]] list which i currently have in a different system
3. Split between work and personal for daily notes in particular is a pain

# Closed
1. Won't do that just YAGNI
2. [[Time Blocking]] strategy with shared calendar
3. won't be needed re [[Time Blocking]]
	1. Action items that cut across will use todo intake
