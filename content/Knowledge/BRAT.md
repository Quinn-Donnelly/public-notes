Parent:: [[Obsidian Plugin]]
supports:: [[Obsidian Plugin Development]]

This plugin allows you to point to [[Github]] repos and tags. If you point to something it needs the main.js file there and likely the manifest. I have created [[Github Releases]] to have main.js and the manifest file and that works.
