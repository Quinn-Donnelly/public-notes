- Do current job well
	- Make sure your manager agrees that you are doing your current job well. 
- Ask your manager what they need
- Do it
- Then ask them if there is anything that you can help them and also help you
- repeat

A good manager will do these things for you but this model moves it into your control. Not all managers are strong and sometimes they are just busy.

As you move up especially at the executive level you are now expected to be proactive. Instead of the explicit conversation it's now hey here are some things that I see that should be solved and here are some opportunities I see. Your more keeping your bosses in the loop than getting the idea or task from them here you start driving.

At the senior manager level you'll have to change the way you work. [[What got you here wont get you there]]. You will have to get out of the details and more into how you coordinate.
