# Summary 
The takeaway is that you should plan goals that are achievable in 12 weeks. Start with a vision then create that goal. Make it measurable with [[Lead Indicators]] and [[Lag Indicators]] focus on measuring and hitting your [[Lead Indicators]] and the [[Lag Indicators]] will follow. To do so time management will be key use the 3 time blocks - [[Strategic Time Block]], [[Buffer time block]], [[Breakout time Block]].

## Lessons 
### Annual goals fall apart
Annual goal setting doesn't work as it drives the most urgency at the end of the year and allow slip ups to last the other 11 months.
[[Periodization]] is the inspiration for the approach.

#### Create a vision
#### Create a way to track it

### Rigorous review Weekly 
You should measure with 2 indicators 
[[Lag Indicators]] - end result testing
[[Lead Indicators]] - the actions you take to reach your lead indicator

Focus your efforts on the [[Lead Indicators]] as you have more direct control of them. Accomplishing 85% of your [[Lead Indicators]] will drive you toward your goal.

### Manage your time
To achieve what you set out to do you will need to manage your time well.

The time recommendation here is to block time.
#### Time Blocks
##### [[Strategic Time Block]]
##### [[Buffer time block]]
##### [[Breakout time Block]]
