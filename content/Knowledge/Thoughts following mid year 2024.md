# Summary  
Current thoughts reviewing the outcomes of mid year performance review.
# Body  
The main actionable item is my documentation for what I have done. I need to show pony more to toot my own horn.  
  
The action item here is [[Self Promotion]]  
> [!summary] Toot your own horn  
> Toot your own horn more document everything you do and make sure to sing your own praises. Will need to do this with Cory to send up the chain as well as around E360 to build the brand among the opposition.  

The action item here is [[Diversity of Results]]
> [!summary] Diversify results  
> Seems like points are deducted when they see results in the same field or space and prefer people to have a diverse set of results which is viewed as results that are in different domains that other results.  

The action item here is [[mentoring]]
> [!summary] Mentoring  
> As expected there were callouts of empower as that is likely the lowest metric for all associate surveys. I will need to make sure that I am "empowering" our org. Though I can't fix contributions I can mentor more junior associates that reach beyond my direct team.  

The action item here is [[Technical Branding]]
> [!Summary] Presentations at Conferences (internal and external)  
> To get to DE I will have to have racked up presentations at a mix of internal and external speaking engagements.  

The action item here is [[Community Building]]
> [!Summary] Community Building - forums  
> Play an active role in a community. Likely means I need to start with the [[E360]] Tech Scrum. [[E360 Tech Scrum]]. Will need to expand this to broader cases like the IaC COP potentially.  

The concern here is [[SM does not promote to DE often]] as well as [[2024 Weak Director level leaders]]
> [!danger] Time in Role and History of DE Promotion  
> Given that I have only ever actually known of one person that got promoted to DE from SM IC I have little faith in staying in this role and getting there.  
>    
>  Based on the DEs I talk to, the other two paths are far more likely to get there. One is to be a people leader Dir then transition into DE. The second is to leave the company and come back as a DE. Given I tried the first path and hate the mundane role of PL paper pusher the later seems to be my path forward.  

The concern here is [[Leadership Turnover]]
> [!Danger] Current Leadership  
> With leaders that roll over every year and a next level audience that buys into the Capital One process more than they have their own opinions grounded in personal expertise I will be fighting an uphill battle.
