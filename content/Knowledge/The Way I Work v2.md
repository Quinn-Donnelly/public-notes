# Background
The purpose of "the way I work" series of writing is to track what my process actually is. 

Personally I use it as a bit of an audit. My workflow goes through expansions and contractions naturally. "The way I work" is a practice I do to help with contracting my workflow and distilling it down to the essential parts.


> [!TLDR] Simplification
> If you force me to write down my process it will become much more simple... Because I'm lazy, and I use that to my advantage

So I write this for me with the goal of simplification. Others may find it useful as a way to see how I work and steal parts for themselves.

> [!WARNING] Adopt with Caution
> The way we work is very personal. Two recommendations:
> 1. Don't adopt multiple things at once, resist that urge. Add most valuable thing first, evaluate it's effect, keep or discard, and then repeat.
> 2. Take the **WHY** of my process and ask yourself it applies to you. The specifics of how I do it are irrelevant, the notes I take, capture systems imployed, etc. don't matter as much as the thing I'm trying to do and how my systems help me do it.

# The Core
The way I view my system today is through the lens of two buckets.

**Cadence**  
The goal is to make sure that I balance short term and long term thinking. While also ensuring I don't spend too much time on "meta" work. I want the vast majority of my time going towards actually doing.

**Practices**  
Things that help me **DO**. They facilitate an outcome.

## [[My Cadences]]
- [ ] I should make my cadences be the parent instead of everything having [[The Way I Work v2]] as the parent

### [[Future]]
- A current working view of the future, anytime I'm planning or making decisions I keep this view in mind
- It's action based not outcome based - see [[Future]] for more details

### [[Yearly]]
- ![[Yearly#^hhp0h7]] 
- Reflect on the year 
### [[12 Week]] 
- Move rocks one at a time

### [[Weekly]]
- The strategy of the day plans
### [[Daily]]
- day plans
- Daily working memory

## Practices
### [[Capture]]
- Mainly used to control my wandering brain
 
### [[spaced repetition system|Spaced Repetition System]]
- Memory practice

### Trackers
- Really don't care which one currently using ___ but need to measure to change.

### Alarms
- Used for time ques 
	- Caffeine alarm
	- morning alarm
	- night shutdown

### [[Working in Public]]
- The newest addition to the way I work
- Jury is out on whether or not this is valuable or not

### Tags

> [!TODO] Maybe move tag later
> tags is more of a processing thing some capture comes in raw

I use a few tags to help me organize my inputs.

"#idea" - this is specifically for things that aim to change something for a potential improvement  
"#pain" - me complaining on paper (digital paper of course)

Some things are not ideas or pains. They go on untagged.  

### Note Taking
- Journal
- Expanding working memory
- Practical recall and use of side effects

### Todo
- Action based todo list
- GTD?? ish
- It's just a fancy list - always has been
- I do have a few ways I like it to work I'm picular
# Implementation

## Tools in use
Here is an idea of the tools I currently use for each of my practices. At some point I'll update pages on each of them to explain key features of why I use that particular tool. Note that 99% of the time the tool doesn't matter. There is a workflow I'm trying to maintain an I pick tools that fit that workflow, if multiple can then [I](https://g.co/kgs/qhgoF8X).

Calendar: [[Google Calendar]]  
Notes: [[Obsidian]]  
Todo: [[Notion]]  
[[spaced repetition system|Spaced Repetition System]]: [[Anki]]  
[[Capture]]: [[Notion]] - this is primary, though I do have [[Obsidian]] with Sync on my phone to do so as well there are drawbacks to doing that but lets call this allowed inefficiency for now.  
Alarms: Basic built in alarm app.  
- One notable exception is that to wake up I do use a light alarm
	- I don't know that it's necessary but I do find that waking up over the course of a period of time makes me feel better early in the morning.
