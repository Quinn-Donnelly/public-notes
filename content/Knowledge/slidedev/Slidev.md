>Overall I think the graphs make this an interesting project. I also think it makes the slides focus on the content and not so much on the presentation which i like for the delivery of content. Much less distracting

Uses [[Vue]] components for interactivity allows users to make slide shows from Markdown but I think at the end of the day it likely wouldn't scale well at work

when exporting you will need to install another dev dep that handles the conversion
`npm i -D playwright-chromium`

It would allow for the quick setup of demoing code. 

The diagrams that can be done are very interesting - [docs](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html)

Stanky plots are always nice

I do think that the markdown based nature of the slide shows makes me more productive in that we don't waste time with all the formatting and things that are generally done in slides. This puts greater focus on the actual presentation.

Comments are the main collaberation feature that is missing obviously pushing to git works for me but then we are missing things such as the ease of comments for external parties. Will need to test what and how pdf comments work in google drive

Well comments are a solved issue for external parties the issue now is likely more to do with change management as once I make a change and re upload i'm sure i will lose the ability to see those historical comments.

Using `{}` you can call out line numbers and `all` to focus lines in the *presentatioin*
