Here are the key research papers for each of the concepts you mentioned:

### 1. **Goal-Setting Theory**
- **Key Paper**: Locke, E. A., & Latham, G. P. (1990). *A Theory of Goal Setting & Task Performance*. Prentice Hall. 
  - **Summary**: Locke and Latham's work on goal-setting theory is foundational in understanding how setting specific, challenging goals, coupled with appropriate feedback, can lead to higher performance. Their research emphasizes the importance of goal commitment, self-efficacy, and task complexity in achieving desired outcomes.

- **Further Reading**: Locke, E. A., & Latham, G. P. (2002). "Building a practically useful theory of goal setting and task motivation: A 35-year odyssey." *American Psychologist, 57*(9), 705–717.
  - **Summary**: This article provides a comprehensive review of the goal-setting theory, summarizing 35 years of research and detailing how goals influence performance.

### 2. **The Hawthorne Effect**
- **Key Paper**: Roethlisberger, F. J., & Dickson, W. J. (1939). *Management and the Worker*. Harvard University Press.
  - **Summary**: This book is a primary source on the Hawthorne Studies, which were conducted at the Western Electric Hawthorne Works in the 1920s and 1930s. The studies revealed that workers' productivity increased when they were being observed, leading to the formulation of the "Hawthorne Effect."

- **Further Reading**: Adair, J. G. (1984). "The Hawthorne effect: A reconsideration of the methodological artifact." *Journal of Applied Psychology, 69*(2), 334–345.
  - **Summary**: This paper revisits the Hawthorne Effect and provides a critical analysis of the original studies, exploring how the phenomenon has been interpreted and misinterpreted over time.

### 3. **Behavioral Economics**
- **Key Paper**: Thaler, R. H., & Sunstein, C. R. (2008). *Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness*. Yale University Press.
  - **Summary**: This book is a seminal work in behavioral economics, introducing the concept of "nudges"—small interventions that can significantly influence behavior without restricting choices. It has had a profound impact on public policy and personal decision-making.

- **Further Reading**: Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1979). "Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk." *Econometrica, 47*(2), 263–291.
  - **Summary**: This paper introduced Prospect Theory, which is fundamental to behavioral economics. It explores how people make decisions under risk, challenging the traditional economic assumption that individuals are rational actors.

These sources provide foundational knowledge in their respective areas and have been widely cited in both academic and practical applications.
