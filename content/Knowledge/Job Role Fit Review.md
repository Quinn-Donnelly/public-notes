# Summary 
Review for 12 week year job role fit.
# Body
Overall I think I defaulted my way to victory with this one. I threatened to leave I started looking at some job postings but I didn't do anything externally. I know I'm not in shape to tackle the job market at the moment. My programming is declining. I dont' do it day in and day out like I once did. That has hurt my ability to perform in a technical interview. However, some of the higher level skills like [[System Design Interview]]s I would knock out of the park far better than I ever would have.

- [ ] I will need to ensure I don't allow myself to get too out of practice with programming

Outside of that my other path to victory is the one that actually ended up coming to me. I was able to shed people leader to a new hire. I now have a role as the senior lead IC and I have enough buy in from high level leaders to pave the way to a DE role. All I need to do is execute on it. 

My new role will be spear heading E360 and it's developer practices. No one knows what they want from me but they all have high expectations of what I will deliver. 

## Outcome 
Identified a gap in my skills. I am deteriorating on skills that are key to me and will need to address. However, I was able to meaningfully fix the pain points of my role. I now have far more freedom in my tasks.  

The 2 outcomes that I am worried on is people. As in I need people that I can learn from and the other is location freedom. I am still tied to a location. However, once things settle down I can likely leverage my position to go fully remote. 

- [ ] Get programming skills sharpened up again
- [ ] Get location exception in the works
- [ ] Find mentor
