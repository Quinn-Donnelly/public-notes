# Summary 
The idea is to line up an attack that would hit two pieces one on a higher value piece such that you can take a lower value one when the high value moves out of the way.
# Body
Very similar concept to fork but your doing it indirectly instead of directly. Remember much like forks you can sack a piece to put people into positions that are forkable or skewerable.
