# Summary 
There is no "To be" verb in Japanese. Thus for nouns you use だ and that indicates a state of being so. It can also be implied.
# Body
Apparently there are also adjectives specifically 'na' な-adjectives that will also follow this rule.

In general seems this rule is a pain and typically only used when a need to be declarative. Otherwise state of being is assumed such as greetings with 元気? and response 元気.
