# What?
Capture for me is making sure that all ideas and requests go to one place so that I can process them at one time. From there they go to die. Few will survive and live on to the done column.

## In Practice
Currently I use [[Notion]] as my primary capture tool. I have a button on all screens of my phone and a hotkey on my computer that once hit allows me to write down the thought.

These get processed later in [[Processing]] for now they sit in an intake list.

# Why?

My brain loves to have ideas and generally loves to over value ideas. There are two primary issues that caused me to adopt this Capture system.
1. I can tell my brain to let it go
	- I will stay stuck on an idea loving the idea and playing with it in my head like a distracting toy. This takes me off task and away from what I was intending to remain focused on.  
	- This practice allows me to tell my brain: "It's there we will think about it later now back to task". If I don't do this my brain likes to constantly remind me of the idea while working as to now forget it.
2. I don't make good investment decisions in the moment
	- If I allow my mind to make a call right then and there about whether or not I will or will not proceed with some idea or solving some problem I am more likely to spend my time in wasteful a manner.
	  
	  I generally over value new ideas and find additional time between idea inception and decision making allows me to increase the rationality of my decisions. Especially around how I spend my time.

I'm sure having capture systems has given me more positive benefits than what is listed above. In my professional life where I need to juggle multiple priorities being organized helps. But the above 2 are my primary reasons why I put up with the toil.
