# Body
To be able to hit the [[mentoring]] milestone of the [[Distinguished Engineer]] expectations I will make sure that I coach more engineers than anyone else. This was based on my empower feedback in [[Thoughts following mid year 2024]]. 

Since I can't fix [[Innersourcing]] for the enterprise tooling I will need to provide support in other means the most readily available of which will be mentoring.
