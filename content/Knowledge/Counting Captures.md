# Summary 
If you have more than them attacking is usually good.
# Body
Try to have a count on each square. This will tell you where you are weak on the board and where your opponent is weak. 

This idea relates back to [[Counting value of pieces]] as if I have 2 and he has 1 and we trade I can come count up but maybe not value up. ex. I have 2 first queen then rook, he has pawn with pawn defender. He's happy to make this trade.
