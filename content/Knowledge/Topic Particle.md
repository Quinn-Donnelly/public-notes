# Summary 
The topic particle is the character 「は」. Now, while this character is normally pronounced as /ha/, it is pronounced /wa/ only when it is being used as the topic particle.
# Body
Not that once topic is established in conversation you don't need to repeat it

Example 1

- ボブ: アリスは学生？
- Bob: Is Alice (you) student?

- アリス: うん、学生。
- Alice: Yeah, (I) am.

Here, Bob is indicating that his question is about Alice. Notice that once the topic is established, Alice does not have to repeat the topic to answer the question about herself.
