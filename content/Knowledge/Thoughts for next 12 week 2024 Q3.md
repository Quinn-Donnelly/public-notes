# Summary 

# Body
## Personal 
I think [[Learning Japanese]] [[Cooking]] and [[Chess]] are all things I could start doing more in my life to enrich it for the next goal in the 12 week. 

I am still not where I need to be for my physical health as of yet I think hitting the gym is still that thing I need to do however, I also think I should start getting more into something. Some sort of sport or something. Climbing sounds cool it's quite the commitment price wise though. 

[[Climbing]]

[[Learning Japanese]] has the reward of I know we will be making another trip there and it would be really cool to be able to converse with people. 

[[Cooking]] is something I just really enjoy the process of though I may end up running a bill as well. Though if I do it right I could end up saving money and eating healthy if I go this path. Chess is a good hobby for me to pick up to get my mental up. 

I also think committing to building something like [[Syndication Client]] for [[RSS]] and [[Atom]]. 


### Next 12 Week
- [ ] Increase the intellectual rigor of my life
	- [ ] Chess daily get to 1000 rated
	- [ ] Have learned [[Hirigana]] and [[Katagana]] and the N5 Kanji for vocab
	- [ ] Have at least 10 new dishes that I make regularly on hand that I like. this should mean refrigerator has the things to make this on hand. Or can from memory throw it together. 

### Counter Points
#### Why not Social
The one concern I have going this direction is that I do need to get more social. That will take active effort to do. I am not naturally inclined to host or organize social gatherings. 

The only thing that makes me think I should do the above first is that to have good conversations you need to get yourself in order first. I don't' feel I have myself in a good place yet to be able to properly navigate the social space yet. I need to make my next social moves correctly as those will be friends that end up forming much of one of the largest pivot points in life. 
#### Overloaded Plan
I also worry that I am aiming for a bit too much here. Going after [[Chess]] and [[Learning Japanese]] at the same time is alot on my brain and habit forming already. Then trying to make the cooking on top of that seems like I am asking for trouble.

## Professional
Gaining [[mentee]]. Growing my sphere of [[Influence]]. 

Need to spread out in [[E360]] and cover more ground those that know me know my caliber but there are many that doesn't interact with me on a regular basis that won't have a concept of where I stand technically. 

Finding the role that I want long term as a [[Distinguished Engineer]]. If I continue where I am I may fall into the trap on mOPL only. I will need to align myself a bit better if my goal is the [[Automate]] DE. 

The things mentioned in [[My Next phase of Career]] is likely a good starting place for things to do next for 12 week. 

1. Writing
	1. A skill I lack depth in and will be key to scaling further
	2. I can hit two birds with one stone by making use of sharing my writing like publishing blogs maybe getting involved in writing storm. 

Outside of this I should align with my leaders what percent of my role should be what so that I can focus in on a few things to do well rather than spreading myself thin. 

Doing talks -> making [[presentation]]s and writing source this is the next focus. 
### Next 12 week
Something like
- [ ] Publish X papers
- [ ] Do X presentations
- [ ] Have taken on 3 [[mentee]]s and documented impact of mentorship
- [ ] Have brag document with __ weeks of results in it
- [ ] [[E360 Tech Scrum]] Running with agenda maintained by me 
- [ ] Will need to deliver agreed upon BAU results as well
### Counter Points

> [!NOTE] Since been updated
> note I have modified these items since the taking of notes from this section

This isn't a result necessarily. I could end up struggling to make it to [[Distinguished Engineer]] if I go this path may end up being slower than if I focused on tangible results. 

I think of this like a long term investment. I know that I could likely forge a path that moves faster. However I also feel that once I get to [[Distinguished Engineer]] I will need this foundation that I am lacking in.

### Thoughts following Mid year results
- [ ] Mentor X people? How do I measure the success of my involvement with people? 

This point is good as it provides a solution to one of the action items called out in [[Thoughts following mid year 2024]]. 
- [[mentoring]] action item

- [ ] Publish X papers
- [ ] Do X presentations

These two will help with the action item of Presentations at conferences. As there needs to be 5 results that show my technical expertise. Doing papers and talks is one of the ways to get that. Given Diversify results is also one of them then having papers, presentations, and my BAU work will help me get that. 

#### Things to solve for in current plan
We do not have a plan to address the [[Self Promotion]] gap. 

We do not have a plan for [[Community Building]]

We do not have a plan for [[Diversity of Results]] other than pretensions and papers being a different medium of delivery where I could diversify the topic. 

This also doesn't quite cover a plan to close [[Technical Branding]] as doing presentations alone won't get me there I will need to do presentations in conferences that gain that branding not some internal E360 presentation.

It does address [[mentoring]] and to a minimal extent [[Technical Branding]]

###### [[Community Building]]
[[E360 Tech Scrum]] getting kicked off and run by me. That's the most available as well as movement toward what needs to happen. I'll likely need to increase the scale of what I do for that But this is a good next step.

- [ ] [[E360 Tech Scrum]] is running with my leadership observable
###### [[Diversity of Results]]

###### [[Self Promotion]]
I will see what my leaders can do here via me providing the ammunition. I will also shoot one shot per month as backup. 

- [ ] Every week I will post my accomplishments to [[Cory Williams]]. We will build them up week over week to share out. Monthly I should post in one of the forum channels for E360 to shout out the team or work that I lead. 
###### [[Technical Branding]]
I need to have a talk that hits. I should just focus on presentation quantity right now. As I get reps in I will have some options for presentations that could be presented externally where some of the politics might not hit me so much.

The earlier result should be able to hit this 
- [ ] Do X presentations and Y papers / blogs
###### [[mentoring]]
RiseUp will cover much of this. Make sure I do this and follow up with [[Mohammad Hussan]] about Amir and whether or not I should reach out to him to start that engagement. 

- [ ] Drive results with [[mentee]] get feedback of outcome I drove collect that together and present as one bullet outcome
