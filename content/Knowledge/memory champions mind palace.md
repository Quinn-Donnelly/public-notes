# Summary 
They use physical places that they have already in mind. They map numbers onto objects in those places. Then they rote memorize numbers for those objects going around clockwise. This allows then to map images onto those locations. 
# Body
What memory systems do they use I should learn some of these

I don't feel myself needing this sort of memory device at the moment.
