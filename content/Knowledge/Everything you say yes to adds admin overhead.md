# Summary 
If you say yes to something you get all the administrative overhead of saying yes whether you are working on it or not
# Body
The reason to say no to things is because if you say yes but it won't be immediate then because you say yes you will have the overhead of needing to have the recurring meetings for it.

This means while you don't intend on actually making progress it will be slowing you down.
