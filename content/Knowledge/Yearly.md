I don't do much work on a yearly cadence. I find things like [[New Year's Resolutions]] to be generally ineffective.  ^hhp0h7

Instead I use this as a social queue to sum up the year and take a step back to appreciate the progress I've made. It's interesting to look back and see the things that stick in your head.

Check out [[Brandon Boswell Year in Review]] for a great example that inspired me.

For the highest level of what I would consider plans see [[12 Week]] or [[Vision]].
