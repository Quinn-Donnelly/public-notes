a system of comprehensive capture with notes, browser link visited, thoughts & notes, everything like a Jupiter notes book of thought and work.

a command or way to access a "daily" note from any of the systems you work on, chrome, terminal, etc.

command to publish blog posts that are given directly from notes likely a markdown renderer

should likely look at [excaildraw](https://excalidraw.com/) a graphing thing - [open source repo](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw)

an image renderer would never work in vim I feel like there are ways to make that work

[[Zettelkasten]] the note taking system used in the video - "[[how to take smart notes]]" book referenced
