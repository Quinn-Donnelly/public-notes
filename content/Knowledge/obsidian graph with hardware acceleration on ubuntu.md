Parent:: [[Obsidian]]

It won't work in the [[Flatpal]] you must use an [[AppImage]]. On [[Mayonaka]] I have a folder in `.local/share` named `obsidian`. That folder has a desktop icon, [[AppImage]], and png for the image.

If you want to use hardware accel which you will want to on the [[Obsidian Graph]] then you will need to do the above.
