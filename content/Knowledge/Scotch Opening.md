# Summary 
White opens e4 kf3 d4 this is an aggressive opening.
# Body
You look to trade in the center open the d file and trade queens. Good follow up move is now to attack the undefended f pawn since the king had to retake the queen. This will also prevent [[Chess Castling]]

Most popular response to scotch is to capture the d pawn. In such a case retake with knight. be4 to add a defender to the knight is correct.
