# Summary 
When you pin something to the king you can attack the pinned piece as they can't move out of the way. 
# Body
I don't know why I didn't reason that prior but today's puzzles made me understand the true utility of the pin. At first I thought it was just about stopping them from moving to capture but if it's a good piece you can take it by another attack that it would normally move out of the way for.
