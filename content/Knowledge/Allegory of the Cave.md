Question your understanding of reality. The unexamined life is not worth living.

Prisoners in a cave that can only look at the wall
Fire behind the view of the prisoners
People will walk past with objects to cast distorted shadows
prisoners take this as reality and assign names to the shadows 

One escapes the cave and goes to the surface
> The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size.

he gets used to the surface
he then goes back to the cave to share 
but being used the sun light he is then disoriented by the darkness of the cave
those in the cave take his disorientation as the surface having made him imbecilic

It's an intricate metaphor symbolizing the predicament of a philosopher tasks with enlightening the masses. Most people not only find solace in their ignorance but also exhibit hostility towards those who challenge their preconceived notions.

[[Plato]] was trained by [[Socrates]] who was killed by the masses for questioning the norms. 

Very similar to the [[Myth of Prometheus]] 

the dissemination of knowledge isn't met with gratitude.
