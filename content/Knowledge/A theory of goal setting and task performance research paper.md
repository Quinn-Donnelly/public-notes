> Goals and Feedback Few concepts in psychology have been written about more uncritically and incorrectly than that of feedback. In organizational settings the aph- orism “what gets measured gets done” describes cogently the positive halo surrounding feedback. Actually, feedback is only information, that is, data, and as such has no necessary consequences at all. Like any fact, its effect on action depends on how it is appraised and what decisions are subsequently made with respect to it. Studies of the effects of feedback typically show positive effects (Kopelman, 1986), but this is because peo- ple often set improvement goals when given information about their past performance. The only way to isolate the effects of feedback as such is to give it in such a form that it cannot be used to set goals (e.g., vary the length of each work period so that the subjects cannot directly compare their performance from one trial to the next). When this is done, feedback has no motivational effect on performance (Locke & Latham, 199Oa). Even more intriguingly, a field experiment showed that even when engi- neers and scientists were urged to do their best, their subsequent perfor- mance was not significantly different from that of a control group. This SELF-REGULATION THROUGH GOAL SETTING 225 occurred despite the fact that they received the same amount of feedback as those people who were in the specific goal conditions (Latham, Mitch- ell, & Dossett, 1978). Feedback that does not lead to the setting of and commitment to specific difficult goals does not increase motivation to increase one’s performance. Figure 6 from Locke and Bryan (1969a) il- lustrates this point. Goal subjects in this study did have feedback about their progress in relation to goals, but feedback subjects did not have goals. Feedback alone did not affect performance. Thus with respect to feedback as a motivator, goal setting is a mediator (cause) of its effects on performance
