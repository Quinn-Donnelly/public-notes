# Why
For many years I have operated on yearly plans. Then I would break those down to quarters then weeks then days. The issue with this was that it encouraged me to take a year to make meaningful change.

This also meant that if I slipped up one quarter it was fine because the "deliverable" wasn't due till year end and I could make up for it in the next quarter. This led to some very busy Q4s and less meaningful change standing the test of time.

In school it was much the same just swap in semesters for quarters.

# What
The idea of this was from [[The 12 week year book]]. Basically the idea is that I needed to have a "right sized" cadence of delivery. Something large enough to make meaningful change but not too large as to encourage procrastination. 

I am not married to it being 12 weeks but something in that general area seems about right. They do loosely sync up with quarters.

52 weeks a year
48 weeks a year for execution
4 weeks for planning / downtime

The order goes something like
1. Week of planning the next 12 week
2. 12 weeks of execution
3. Week of review / planning / taking a breather
4. 12 weeks of execution
5. Week of review / planning / taking a breather
6. 12 weeks of execution
7. Week of review / planning / taking a breather
8. 12 weeks of execution

Toward end of year / beginning of next year the holiday season will end up breaking it up a bit shortening a 12 week here or there but same general plan. 

Once again nothing magic about the number 12. *Unless of course we consider the sum of its divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) equals 16, which is greater than 12 making 12 the smallest of the [abundant numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundant_number)*

# Outcome
Now I aim to build 12 week plans with the following characteristics.

1. They need to move me meaningfully and sustainably toward the [[Future]]
	1. New habit, lifestyle change, big life moves, new skill acquisition, etc.
2. They must be tangible, measurable in some way. 
	1. I usually prefer to have a leading metric be my guide during the 12 week, and a trailing metric inform me if that change is having the effect I was hoping for during planning. I don't concern myself with the trailing metric when I'm executing the 12 week.
3. I limit myself to 2 at a time
	1. part of me wishes I could make this one at a time
	2. My 2 are 1 for professional life and 1 for personal
		1. Simplified example from a few years ago
			1. Professional: Move to a large enterprise company 
			2. Personal: Move into the city proper
