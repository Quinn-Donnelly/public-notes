## By Height Estimate 
This comes from an estimation that [link](https://youtu.be/Pok0Jg2JAkE?t=209) had. It says to take height in cm and that is a good estimate of how much you should intake in grams of protein. 

## By Lean Mass
Another way to do this would be to find lean body mass. Take body weight and subtract [[Body Weight]] times [[Body Fat Percentage]]. 

so currently (234) - (234 * 0.26) = 173.16 
Given I'm on a low point today and have not sustained this weight as of yet I think the height number is likely the better bet for the time being. Given I'd like to gain muscle a bit more than I'm worried about the weight right now.
