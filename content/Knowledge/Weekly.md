- Two parts
	- Review
		- Many of my practices are on the weekly cadence. Each has a goal in mind and this review session is the cue for those tasks to be done
		- I do my Weekly planning on Sunday mornings. This starts with a review then a plan of the next week. All of this is then followed by any practices that I cue off of the weekly cadence. 
			- For the practices I do on a weekly basis check the back links attached to this note
	- Plan
		- I look at my current [[12 Week]] plan that is in effect and ask myself
			- What is the next small step toward accomplishing that 12 week. If I could only do one thing to move closer to it what would I do.
			- I block off my time for what I want to get done
				- My calendar will fill and tasks will take however much time I allow them to take
					- So by making the work blocks explicit on my calendar I make the default state doing that action
					- Natural ability to push back on that time
				- In the [[Daily]] cadence I end up using this as my primary todo list. 
				- I don't usually assign specific tasks to these blocks unless they are a scheduled action
					- An action that is temporally bound such as a meeting, or external due date commitment that I need to have done on a time
