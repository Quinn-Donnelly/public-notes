# Summary 
Notes from working out today
# Body
Very crowded at 5:20

Chest press 
150 10 reps easy - last set at this weight rep felt just right failure wise

Incline dumbell
Felt like hitting same muscle doing 45 for 8 was rough first set
Threw in at 4

Called after crowded plus muscles were feeling took walk
