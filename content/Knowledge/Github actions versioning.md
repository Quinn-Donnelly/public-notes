# Summary
you can have users refer to [[Git Commit SHA]], [[Git Branch]], [[Git Tag]] for the versioning of actions. The branch can be named for a release. They recommend using tags as the way to point users. 

ex.
branch - release/v1 -> will then produce -> v1 tag that always points to the lastest version of release/v1 and also releases a semver tag for that specific release.
