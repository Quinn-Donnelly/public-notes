    I used to! And I personally don't think I'll get another one unless the tech drastically changes

    When I had mine, it was wifi only, couldn't store any music on the watch itself, and a lot of the fitness stuff that comes ootb in apple watches were behind subscriptions for the android watches

    So it ended up just being a glorified digital watch that buzzed when I got an email lol

    I wanted to use the watch when going to the gym instead of having to bring my phone, but looks like I'm still SOL on that front without paying an arm and a leg in the Android world

# Concerns to look into 
1. [[Can Music be brought over into the watch internal storage]]
2. [[Is there a subscription plan for health app]]
