Three tones of voice
1. Assertive
	1. Direct and honest
	2. Almost always counter productive though your people will like it as they will feel "stood up" for
2. Acomendators voice 
	1. Smily voice, happy voice
	2. Usually the helpful one
3. Analyst voice
	1. downward inflecting usually (late fm DJ), soothing calming, but not cold and empty
	2. A good way to take an immovable position without the other side feeling attacked

fight, flight, make friends
