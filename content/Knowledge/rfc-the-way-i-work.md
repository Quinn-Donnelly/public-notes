# Templates / Standards

# [[Personal Knowledge Management]]
## [[LATCH]]
The manner by which my knowledge is organized will conform to at least one of the [[LATCH]] data points. Optimally it will conform to all that apply but never at the cost of efficiency or automation.
### [[Location]] 
#### Geo Tags
Using the command palette you can add a geo tag with ^p `inline` select `inline geo tag` and then search for a location that can be fuzzy searched. 

This will implement the ideas in [[LATCH#Location]] 


### [[Alphabet]]
#### Naming conventions
Q[1-4] YYYY - ...
- Will be used for [[12 week year]]
YYYY-MM-DD-plan
- Will be used for [[Weekly Plan]] and will be the date of the Sunday for that week and will be the date of the Sunday for that week. Weeks will start on Sunday.
MOC
- Map of Content
YYYY-MM-DD
- Daily Note
Parent Domain Prefix
- Things that are of a working session will have a "prefix" applied to it so that I can pull all items in the domain. Not everything will need this but titles and notes that are "general" though the note applies to one specific use should use the parent's prefix.
	- Ex. 
		- RulesLab BDD - ...
		- Github Actions - ...

### [[Time]]
#### Daily Notes
Will be used to organize content by time. This is to implement the [[LATCH#Time]] idea put forward in [[LATCH|latch]]. 

Using daily notes would become cumbersome thus will be automated with [[rfc-the-way-i-work#Templates / Standards|Templates]]

### [[Category]]
#### Tags
Used for state, as well as unchanging "types" such as the source type material. In general use [[Links]] if there is any doubt.
- type
	- "#video-review "
- flags
	- "#idea" 
	- "#pain" 
	- "#completed" 
	- "#in-progress"
	- generally anything that calls to action on the note

### [[Heirarchy]]

#### [[Links]]
Relationships which can have an optional [[Ontology]] componenet.
#### [[Ontology]]
This will closely relate to the idea of Maps of Content. The following ontology will be used in my notes. 
- Parent::
- Author::
- Previous::
- Next::
- Occurred-on::
- Supports::
## [[Maps of Content]]
The goal is to have a visual knowledge management mechanism for traversing the knowledge graph. This will happen in two ways.
1. Crafted
	1. for area maps to help navigate to the main ideas and the thoughts in a session. This will be like roadgraphing's next step. My thought process will remain visual and will link out to the outputs of the session. These graphs will be tailored to help organize my thoughts 
2. Automated
	1. Obsidian graph
	2. Excaibrain
	- The idea of having an automated option for maps of contents is to have a fallback should i ever not have the crafted map built. This will also help ensure that I have the ability to query along these relationships.

- [ ] Need to determine what "home maps" there will be so that i can follow a recommended practice from [[Nick Milo]] to have all maps somehow eventually link back to a home map

# Delivery
This is the more tactical side of the document in how I get things done and approaches I take to being efficient.
## Goal Setting 
I subscribe to the belief that steps are hard but necessary sizing the tricky part however the most effective cycle is the shorter one. Thus [[12 week year]] will be my approach.
### Principals
### Don't Share your goals
Cheap fulfillment people give praise too easy don't accept that it will soften your resolve.
### [[Vision]]
Every 12 week cycle I will look at the vision of the future and select a goal or target to hit in the next 12 weeks. This vision and goal will be in my daily note and todo.
### [[Weekly Plan]]
Todo system will have a weekly reoccurring review on Sundays. 
### [[Daily Plan]]
### [[Time Blocking]]

## [[Task Management]] 
Will use the [[GTD]] framework.
### [[Intake]]
### [[Do Next]]
### [[Someday]]
### [[Delegated]]
### [[Scheduled]]
