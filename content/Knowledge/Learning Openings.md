# Summary 
I don't have even a single variant of an opening memorized. This leads me to needing to calculate ever move starting from turn 3 or sooner and often not quite cutting it. I have resolved to mitigating this by playing very principled chess in the opening for now. 
# Body
Likely should actually learn some of the lines of the queens pawn.
