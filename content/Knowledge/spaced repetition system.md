# What am I doing with this?
What I use this for is effectively my takeaways. Things that resonate with me. Ah Ha moments or key insights and learnings that I want to recall the specifics of so that they are committed to memory. It's been expanding as of late but for now that should suffice an explanation of how I use it.

My current system of choice is [[Anki]] - [link](https://ankiweb.net/) 
- Note I have very limited opinions on one tool over the other in this space

# What is all of this about?
I am not qualified enough to really explain this one. For me it's an area I'm currently exploring.

So

Let me point you in the direction that peaked my interest enough for me to adopt this method.

	- There were compelling enough to at least warrant a trial for me in a broader use case than just foreign language vocabulary

The above two authors worked on a project [[quantum country]] that I find fascinating. [link to quantum country](https://quantum.country/). Find more about it here [Andy's notes on it](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Quantum_Country?stackedNotes=zqetsQERteJhyPitmRoaeE)
