Currently the tab key placement is right next to `ESP` which can be a bit of an issue when working in [[neovim]]. 

Thus the thought is to move away from having the right hand system key. I should move one of the `Ctrl` buttons down to the bottom row of the thumb cluster and likely add the `\t` key to the thumb cluster.
