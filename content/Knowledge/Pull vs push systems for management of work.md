# Summary 
Should switch knowledge work to be a pull based system.
# Body
All asks go into a system then people working pull the next task instead of pushing work on others. This combined with [[Transparent workload with people]] would be a good system change.

Pull work from a queue and measure throughput is much more likely to work out than pushing X on them.
