# Summary 
The idea is to automate my routine and my tasks to help keep me on track and to avoid high failure recall tasks.

The main things I will need to improve to do this is my [[AI Tools]] work and my [[Android Development]] work. The rest should be up my wheel house other than the [[Embedded Systems]] work which I will likely be very rusty on.
