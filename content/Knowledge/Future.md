I like to map out my view of the future. A bit of a map of my current view of the future. I don't call it a 5 year plan because I have no clue how far off it is. I do this to primarily distill what it is that I'm after. 

Two key things with this.
1. I prefer to frame this in terms of actions not outcomes
2. I must represent uncertainty in this view
	1. I find that exploring the assumptions / uncertainty in my view of the future is the thing that gives me the most clarity on what is actually important to me.
