# Meetings
They are an output of the job there are required meetings either by me my bosses or my work. The nature of our work is heavy workstation involvement count and each brings a bunch of administrative overhead. 
# Challenge
The hard part is not doing the job technical work it's working with the organizations and people. 
# Talent Density
More the lack thereof, we have some very talented people in the company but they work so far from one another that the day to day we deal with lower performance. 
# Administrative 
Most of my job is setting meetings organizing time lines and getting commitment and communications out. My technical depth is only used on occasion and typically used to raise concerns about a given direction. 
# People Leader
While I don't mind leading people, at capital one this means the major part of my job is [[Performance Management]] and the 1010s along with other work affiliated with managing people.
