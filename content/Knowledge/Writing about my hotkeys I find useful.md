# Summary 
An idea to write about some of my easy to adopt productivity tooling that I use at work.
# Body

## Workspace
I use workspace or virtual desktops in both my professional and personal computer usage. Personally I use [[i3]] to have many workspace that I can then jump to quickly with key bindings. 

At the tap of a button I can have Slack focused, another button press and I am back in my editor, and once again to look something up on the web is one button away. My brain loves the idea of being "one button away". I make an active attempt to have my most common actions be in this category. 

To achieve this I assign my common tasks a home. While the specific assignments don't matter, you should choose what fits your needs, here is what works for me. 
1. Music - this is usually [[Spotify]] or [[youtube]]
2. Communication - At work this is [[Slack]]
3. Web - I always have my browser here (I use [[Firefox]] for a reason mentioned later)
4. Editor - Code editor is always open here. I use a couple depending on what I'm working on as is the nature of those who work on developer tooling
5. Notes - My preferred note application is [[Obsidian]] 

Now that I have the above organizational system in my mind I set keybindings to jump to each one. For this all you need is a modifier key and the corresponding number. For me I use Alt as my modifier. So if I press Alt 1 I jump to my music, Alt 3 I'm at my browser and alt 5 I'm at my notes.

While this is a small change and if you measured two people one using a similar system and one that doesn't I'm not sure you'd see meaningful output differences. there is something to be said about how fun it is and the mindset it puts you in having the computer be a tool that fits your needs. Thinking of all actions as commands and lessening the communication barrier between intent and action between mind and computer.
