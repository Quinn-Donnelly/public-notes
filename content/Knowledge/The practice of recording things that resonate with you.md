# Summary 
Encountered from a [[Cal Newport]] Deep questions pod cast. It said that to help write a story of where you want to be in 10 years it's best to find things that resonate with you. To this end record it and for a while review these each month, steady state maybe once a year. Thus I have made #resonate tag.
