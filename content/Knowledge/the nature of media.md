"The medium is the message"

"Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of the communication."

## Idea
The core idea is that how the message is delivered will form the society more. When this was discussed by [[Mark Manson]] I was intrigued at the idea that reading the newspaper required high levels of baseline participation to get information whereas now we death scroll to get information requiring almost no thinking or engagement.
