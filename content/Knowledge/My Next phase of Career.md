# Summary 
What do I do next and what skills should I be acquiring to be ready for the step that comes after that. 
# Body
With my role moving back to focus on being an [[Individual Contributor]] I will need to think about how to excel next. I am well positioned to preform well at [[Capital One]] in the [[Senior Manager]] rank. Quickly though I will be seen as preforming on par with the [[Distinguished Engineer]]s thus I will need to be ready for what's next.

## Skills that I'm weak in
- Making visuals 
	- Slides for presentations
	- graphics for explaining concepts 
	- Graphs of data that I can use in my presentations to make a case for something
- Querying data
	- My query skills are rusty and basic 
	- My knowledge of our datasets is minimal
- Networking
	- Many know me but only directly through my immediate work 
	- I don't approach many people these days to talk I do well in key moments but not globally
- Sharing
	- I don't publish anything
	- I don't share my wins or celebrate
	- presentations at conferences 
- Writing
	- My writing is very rough I have the correct vision of how to structure some things for content but I can't execute
- How to play the role of advocate
	- I always play the role of contributor which I am very good at but that is high time demand
	- I need to figure out ways to be clear with people that I can help give body to the idea and sounding board but I can't play an active role in what they need
