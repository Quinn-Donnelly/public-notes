I like the idea of the cycle and measure I'm not super disappointed at this other than Sunday reviews think through this

This needs to be a review item on [[2024-03-10]]


# Summary 
Process by which we break down the goals of where we want to be and deliver them in iterative chunks focusing on one a time span large enough to make change but small enough to minimize the cost of derailment.
# Body
## Create a Vision
Create a vision of where you want to be. This should be a vision 12 weeks in the future.

## Set up a tracking system
Similar idea to what gets measured is what gets done.

This needs to include [[Lag Indicators]] and [[Lead Indicators]] we measure the [[Lead Indicators]] during delivery.

## Weekly review 
This is to shorten the time horizon of slips

## Time Management
Really this is just the how to deliver. Recommendation is [[Time Blocking]]
