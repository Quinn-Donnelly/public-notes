Parent:: [[Github Actions Action]]

What is a composite action? Aparently it has access to `github.action_path` which is in the github [[Github Context]]

# Summary
> A _composite_ action allows you to combine multiple workflow steps within one action. For example, you can use this feature to bundle together multiple run commands into an action, and then have a workflow that executes the bundled commands as a single step using that action. To see an example, check out "[Creating a composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)".
