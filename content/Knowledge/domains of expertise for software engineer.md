# Summary 
My thoughts one night thinking through the domains of competency
# Body
Can you become an expert in software engineering 

My thought is that it's not as a whole but for certain skills you can 

Ex debugging meets the four proposals for pre req of becoming an expert in the video 

I don't know if you can for architecture it has a slow feedback loop but I'm sure if you can study enough architecture then you could pick up patterns study common language of architecture 

Programming is very grey well as the long term implications of design are a slow feedback loop

Communication is similar you could do many presentations but it's slow to figure out if good or bad but certainly they're are r experts in presenting

Approaches to learning?

Reading docs finding answers

Building networks of people leadership etc 

Visualization data but the issue they're also become access and existence of data 

Organizing knowledge 

Delivery Approaches
