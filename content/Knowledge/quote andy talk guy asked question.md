Happiness is balance between myself now and what he wants vs what a future version of myself would have wanted for me

> The quote, "Happiness is the balance between what I want now and what a future version of myself would have wanted for me," doesn't appear to be attributed to a widely recognized source. It seems to capture a modern, self-reflective sentiment about long-term satisfaction versus short-term desires, which is a common theme in personal development and mindfulness literature.

> If you're looking for a similar concept, it echoes ideas found in the writings of philosophers and self-help authors like Stephen Covey or Viktor Frankl, who discuss the importance of aligning present actions with long-term values and goals. However, this specific phrasing doesn't have a well-known origin.
