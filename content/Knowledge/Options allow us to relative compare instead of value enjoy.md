The idea is given options you'll focus on differences trade offs and costs if given 1 that you are doing you are more likely to optimism and enjoy what is offers instead of what it trade offs 

This is likely a key takeaway to bring when taking things up the chain. If I can make a decision and ask for what I need and show value they get they will be much happier than if I take them N number of options and they have to focus on the trade off. Obviously it is sometimes a given that the decision is theirs to make but it is certainly worth considering in some cases.
