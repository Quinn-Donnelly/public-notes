# Summary 
Transparent working list to allow a back pressure on new items being added. Put the burden of trade off on them.
# Body
Let people see the current things of focus and where other things are in the queue. Boss comes to say hey do this say sure thing what moves down.

This would be good if I can find a way in my [[rfc-the-way-i-work]] to make this work into my system that I do day to day.
