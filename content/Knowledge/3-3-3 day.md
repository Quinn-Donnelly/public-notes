Parent:: [[Time Ferriss 30 Things I wish I'd knew at 20]]

Write down your 3:3:3 plan: 3 hours on your most important project, 3 shorter tasks, 3 maintenance activities. Defining a "productive day" is crucial. Or else you'll never be at piece. 

Important note of clarification is that the first 3 is 3 hours on one task that is working on your most important project. Originally I had the mis conception that it was 3 major tasks.
