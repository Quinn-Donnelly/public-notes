Auto setup for my lsp linter formater dap etc.
lsp - language server protocol
linter - rulzzz
formater - I hate whitespace
dap - debuggers are goats (debugger adapter protocol)

Had to put it after my lsp-zero calls. Then it worked well though I will have to track my lsps installed some other way since I don't put them in text now will need to see if there is a dump command or something
