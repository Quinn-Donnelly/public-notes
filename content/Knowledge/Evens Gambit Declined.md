# Summary 
When black doesn't take on b4.
# Body
## Bishop to b6
### Force the gambit
Move a4 and threaten to trap the bishop. Most likely they will go to same position as gambit accepted but with you a pawn up.

Generally good to kick the knight that will take on b4 with pawn to c3. Following this aim for the center with d4.
