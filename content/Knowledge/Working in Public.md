The idea of "Working in Public" has many reported benefits. Whether true or effective I am not equip to say. However, in my experience I get the following benefits from it.

1. Accountability
- There is something about putting my work out there that pulls an increased level of [[Discipline]] from me.
2. [[Teaching is the best form of learning]]
- I use the publication of thought as a sort of teaching proxy. I needed a solution for those times when my fiance is tired of hearing me talk.

There is a high chance I will discover other benefits along the way but for now these are the main ones.
